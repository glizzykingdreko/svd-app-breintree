# SVD Braintree PayPal Payment
I still often get requests for help with the PayPal checkout on SVD, as the app using breintree has SSL pinging on the checkout, so I preferred to publish the necessary requests directly. it is a very simple script for completing a raffle entry via PayPal.
Since it is a pair of requests, it can easily be converted into any other language.

## Getting Started
After loggin in and start submitting your entry, implement your session with the script.
